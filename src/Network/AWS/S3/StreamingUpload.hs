chunkSize = 6*1024*1024 -- Making this 5MB+1 seemed to cause AWS to complain


{- |
Given a 'CreateMultipartUpload', creates a 'Sink' which will sequentially
upload the data streamed in in chunks of at least 'chunkSize' and return
the 'CompleteMultipartUploadResponse'.

If uploading of any parts fails, an attempt is made to abort the Multipart
upload, but it is likely that if an upload fails this abort may also fail.
'Network.AWS.S3.ListMultipartUploads' can be used to list any pending
uploads - it is important to abort multipart uploads because you will
be charged for storage of the parts until it is completed or aborted.
See the AWS documentation for more details.

May throw 'Network.AWS.Error'

{-|
Allows a file or 'ByteString' to be uploaded concurrently, using the
async library.  'ByteString's are split into 'chunkSize' chunks
and uploaded directly.

Files are mmapped into 'chunkSize' chunks and each chunk is uploaded in parallel.
This considerably reduces the memory necessary compared to reading the contents
into memory as a strict 'ByteString'. The usual caveats about mmaped files apply:
if the file is modified during this operation, the data may become corrupt.

May throw `Network.AWS.Error`, or `IOError`.
